## Results Data Availability

Due to their size, the result datasets generated in this project are not included in this repository.

This applies in particular to:
- the daily user activity Parquet files generated per country, and
- the aggregated user summary datasets used for prediction and categorization tasks.

All result data can be accessed via the following link: [heiBOX-Link](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/ae49c6d44bd24c02b4c5/)

The datasets are provided in Parquet format and can be directly used to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in this thesis.
